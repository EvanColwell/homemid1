				<p>Hi my name is Evan Colwell and you've made it to my portfolio which I created using my own template from module 4. This portfolio was difficult to make with the contacts page being the hardest. I now have a newfound respect for web development as I didn't know there were many layers to each website containing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I would recommend to any new student that they should use the resources their professors provide them. Anyways back to my portfolio it will include things such as the assignments I've created in my programming 109 class such as a chessboard, a multiplication table, and a resume.</p>

				<p>I created this website on January 28th 2019.</p>

			<div class="article column2">
				<p>I created it as it was my midterm for my PROG 109 class.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="article column3">
				<p>It was also a place where I could keep all my coursework sorted and showcase what I've made.</p>
